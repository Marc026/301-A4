|     1     |   3    |      1        | Add - O(1), Remove - O(1), Contains - O(1)
|     2     |   4    |      2        | Union - O(n+m), Intersection - O(n+m), Difference - O(n+m), Assignment - O(n) or O(m)

|     4     |   1    |      1        | Load Factor = n / (k*n) = 1 / k
|     5     |   4    |      0        | The optimal number of buckets to have is n, because if we have n items and n buckets the time complexity will be 1 it means that each bucket will have one or two elements which is very optimized way for Adding or Removing or Searching operations. If we have more than n buckets, it is also very good to avoid collisions but not optimized because many buckets might be empty.
